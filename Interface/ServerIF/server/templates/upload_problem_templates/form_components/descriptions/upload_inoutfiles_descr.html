<h2>Upload files with input</h2>
<p>
    It's <b>HIGHLY</b> recommended to meet the following requirements:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Files should be named <b>#.in</b> where <b>#</b> is an <b>integer</b> denoting a test index</li>
        <li><span>&#8704;</span> <b>A < B < C</b>: <b>A.in</b> and <b>C.in</b> were submitted <span>&#8594;</span> <b>B.in</b> was submitted</li>
        <li><span>&#8704;</span> <b>A <span>&#8804;</span> 0</b>: <b>A.in</b> was submitted <span>&#8594;</span> <b>A = 0</b></li>
        <li><b>0.in</b> was submitted</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    If those requirements are not met, <b>the behaviour is undefined!</b>
