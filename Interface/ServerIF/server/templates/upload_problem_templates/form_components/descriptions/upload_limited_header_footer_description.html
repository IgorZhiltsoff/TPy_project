<h2>Upload header and footer</h2>
    It's <b>HIGHLY</b> recommended to meet the following requirements:
    <ul>
        <li>When running, the merged file should not take up more resources than you have provided it with</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Since resource consumption by your and student's code are indistinguishable, you should carry out all "costly" operations in header and footer wisely.
    Otherwise, the student will get an ML or TL
