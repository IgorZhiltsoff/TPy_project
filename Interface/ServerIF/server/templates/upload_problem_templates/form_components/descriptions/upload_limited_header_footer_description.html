<h2>Upload {{semantics}}</h2>
    It's <b>HIGHLY</b> recommended to meet the following requirements:
    <ul>
        <li>When running, the merged file should not take up more than:
            <ul>
                <li>{{time_limit}} seconds</li>
                <li>{{memory_limit_megabytes}} * 2<sup>20</sup> bytes (megabytes) </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Since resource consumption by your and student's code are indistinguishable, you should carry out all "costly" operations in {{semantics}} wisely.
    Otherwise, the student will get an ML or TL
