<h2>Upload {{semantics}} <b>executable</b></h2>
    It's <b>HIGHLY</b> recommended to meet the following requirements:
    <ul>
        <li>The {{semantics}} should be an <b>executable!</b>
            If it is written in, say, Python3, it should have a shebang at its top.
            The interpreters are guaranteed to be stored in <b>/bin</b>, thus all the shebangs should match <b>#!/bin/interpreter</b>.
            Supported interpreters include:
            <ul>
                <li>python3</li>
                <li>sh, bash, zsh</li>
                <li>perl</li>
            </ul>
            If you want to use some exotic interpreted language not listed above
            which just does not support compilation, you may still TRY to submit it and hope that an according
            interpreter is present among the <b>{{bin_dir_file_count}}</b> files in our <b>/bin</b> directory
        </li>
        <li>When running, {{semantics}} should not take up more than:
            <ul>
                <li>{{time_limit}} seconds</li>
                <li>{{memory_limit_megabytes}} * 10<sup>6</sup> bytes (megabytes) </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Upon violation of the points above, the system will terminate testing and return a special type of verdict
